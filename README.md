# Laravel 8 Quiz Application Tutorial


As a participant in this comprehensive tutorial series, I can attest to the immense value it offers. The Laravel 8 Quiz Application, housed in this repository, was developed as part of an instructional journey on the YouTube channel [Codeigniter Hoca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8agLnrUSsnw&list=PLl4iwH7T84H9-TQty5cURnhgoiHDchAQ0). The intent of this series is to shepherd developers from a foundational level to a stage where they can confidently tackle professional project development with Laravel 8.

Creating the Quizzer application from scratch served as a practical test of my understanding, challenging me to apply my knowledge while also demonstrating how to utilize Laravel's latest packages and features such as Fortify, Jetstream, and Validation Request methods.

The learning didn't stop there. The course delved into more advanced topics, including file uploads, question management, quiz result calculations, and developing an analysis system. I was introduced to a variety of Laravel tools and libraries like Eloquent ORM, Carbon, and Eloquent Sluggable, broadening my Laravel expertise.

The series also emphasized the importance of debugging techniques and the creation of additional features for a more robust application. As a developer, this course has been instrumental in honing my Laravel skills and equipping me with the know-how to build real-world applications. I highly recommend it to any developer looking to expand their Laravel proficiency.
